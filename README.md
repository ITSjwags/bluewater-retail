# Bluewater Retail Landing Page

This website was started using the [Gatsby Default Starter](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default)

It follows the [JAMstack architecture](https://jamstack.org) by using Git as a single source of truth, and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) for continuous deployment, and CDN distribution.

## Prototype
[BW Retail Landing Page Prototype](https://bw-retail.netlify.com/)

## Prerequisite

* Gatsby CLI (globally installed)

## Available Scripts

### Develop

```

### Build
Get an optimized production build for your site generating static HTML and per-route JavaScript code bundles.

```

## Deployment
All the files are on GitHub and hosted using Netlify with it's CDN and CI so everything committed to master automatically gets deployed live.
